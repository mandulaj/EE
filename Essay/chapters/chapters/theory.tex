\section{Paschen's Law}
Paschen's Law applies to the breakdown voltage of a gas between two electrodes. It predicts the minimal voltage required to create an arc. According to Paschen's Law, the breakdown voltage of a gas is dependent mainly on two factors. The first being the pressure $p$ and the second the distance between the electrodes $d$. The breakdown voltage $V_{b}$
